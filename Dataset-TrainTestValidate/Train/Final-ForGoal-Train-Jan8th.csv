51,312,review-1,Goal,"Memrise is a learning app that uses spaced repetition to allow users to memorize information in a way similar to using flashcards. I use Memrise to review vocabulary and pronunciation in language learning as presented in various courses. Specifically, I have been using Memrise to learn Mandarin Chinese in my free time. To review the material in courses, I open the app and then tap the upper left hand corner to get to the courses screen(what is shown in the uploaded screenshot). I can review the progress I've made in current(selected)and previous courses. It is possible to undertake multiple courses at once. Daily goals, as in the number of items to review, is indicated by the small rocket icon above the green progress bar. Items that should be reviewed to ensure they are in long term memory are indicated by the watering can icon. The icon of a hand planting a seed indicates new items that can be learned out of a total of all items in the course. After I've made my selection by tapping on the course I wish to continue, the app goes back to the home screen and then I can tap on the large yellow `` Continue learning'' button to proceed with the course. Memrise then proceeds with presenting 25 new items to learn followed by a review.","Memrise is a learning app that uses spaced repetition to allow users to memorize information in a way similar to using flashcards.

49,292,check-1,Goal,The main way I use this screen is to check my progress over time. I like looking at the graphs as they provide a nice easy visual to look at to see how my workouts and eating have been going. In particular in the screenshot you can see my weight over time and this graph easily shows me what kind of trend I am on. Usually I check this screen once a week but sometimes more if I am feeling like I need to check on my progress. Besides weight it also shows my calories consumed and this is another metric that helps me make sure my progress is going in the right direction. The weight chart is just one of the tools I can use but I think its very important to my overall goals of losing weight and gaining muscle. The main interactions I generally have with this is looking at my charts and figuring out how I am doing.,The main way I use this screen is to <tgr> check </tgr> my progress over time.
